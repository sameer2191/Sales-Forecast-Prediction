📖 About the Project

Time-series data is widely used to track and predict patterns over time. This project demonstrates methods to analyze and visualize such data effectively, covering:

    Basic data preprocessing for time-series datasets.
    Identifying trends, seasonality, and stationarity.
    Detecting and handling noise.
    Using differencing and moving averages for smoothening data.

The dataset used in this project includes stock market data with fields like Open, High, Low, and Close prices recorded over time.
📊 Dataset Description
Feature Name	Description
Date	Date of observation (used as index).
Open	Opening stock price.
High	Highest stock price of the day.
Low	Lowest stock price of the day.
Close	Closing stock price of the day.
Volume	Number of stocks traded during the day.
Name	Stock ticker name (e.g., AAPL, TSLA).
🧠 Key Concepts in Time Series Analysis

    Trend: General direction in which data is moving (increasing, decreasing, or constant).
    Seasonality: Recurring patterns or cycles in the data at regular intervals.
    Noise: Random fluctuations not part of trends or seasonality.
    Stationarity: Data whose statistical properties (mean, variance) remain constant over time.
    Differencing: Method to remove trends or seasonality by subtracting consecutive data points.
    Autocorrelation: Measure of similarity between a time series and a lagged version of itself.

⚙️ Technologies Used

    Python: Programming language.
    Libraries:
        NumPy: For numerical computation.
        Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
        Matplotlib: For 2D plotting and visualizations.
        Seaborn: For statistical data visualizations.
        Statsmodels: For advanced statistical analysis.

🔧 Implementation Steps
1. Importing Libraries

    Loaded Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and statsmodels.

2. Loading and Preprocessing Data

    Imported the dataset using pandas.read_csv().
    Parsed Date as a datetime index for proper time-series handling.
    Dropped irrelevant columns like Unnamed: 0.

3. Data Visualization

    Visualized stock prices using line plots.
    Used resampling techniques (monthly averages) to simplify patterns.
    Detected seasonality using autocorrelation plots (ACF).

4. Stationarity Testing

    Performed Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) tests to check for stationarity.
    Applied transformations like differencing and moving averages to make data stationary.

5. Smoothening the Data

    Used differencing to remove trends.
    Applied rolling windows to calculate moving averages for smoothing.

6. Comparative Analysis

    Compared original and transformed datasets.
    Visualized both raw and smoothed data to highlight trends.

📈 Results and Observations

    Resampling: Monthly resampling revealed clear upward trends in stock prices.
    Stationarity: The initial dataset was non-stationary (p-value > 0.05 in ADF test). After differencing, the dataset achieved stationarity.
    Seasonality: ACF plots indicated no significant seasonality in the dataset.
    Smoothening: Moving averages provided a cleaner representation of long-term trends, while differencing removed short-term fluctuations.

🚀 How to Run

    Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/time-series-analysis.git

📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of visualizing and transforming time-series data to uncover meaningful patterns. Key takeaways include:

    Resampling helps simplify and analyze data trends.
    Differencing is crucial for achieving stationarity.
    Smoothening techniques like moving averages enhance interpretability.
